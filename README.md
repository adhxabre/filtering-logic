# Filtering logic

In this repository, we'll be talking about using `.filter()` function which will give you an advantageous of filtering on what you fetch via client-side

## Example

```javascript
data.filter((filter) => filter.data == data);
```

instead of we filtering by each data, this function will be able to only show us the filtered data only, so we don't have to worry about server-side. Just fetch all of the data and use this filter, voila!

the links will be available ASAP so please stay tuned for that!
